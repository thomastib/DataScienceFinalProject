## Spatial Regression

### Data Science: Final Project

Spatial regression is a powerful tool for analyzing spatial data, allowing us to model the relationship between variables while taking into account the spatial relationship between the observations. In this project, we will explore the basics of spatial regression, including its assumptions and limitations. We will also discuss how to fit a spatial regression model and interpret the results. By the end, you should have a better understanding of how spatial regression can be used to analyze spatial data and make predictions.

The repository has two main files: spatial_reg.qmd and spatial_reg.html. The html file contains the final product after running the Quarto file.
